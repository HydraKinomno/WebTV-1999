- Work not started
/ Work started, in progress
✓ Done
x Probably impossible for now
[Text inside brackets are details on the objective at hand]

/ MORE PAGES MORE PAGES MORE PAGES [Abandoned; Added a few new home pages, we just need more service pages]
✓ Add view button/proper TV Home entrance animation [Done]
x Have webcd host music so we can take it down if need be [Abandoned; Previously waiting on webcd - I'm not sure when he'll be able to get around to it]
✓ Get IRC chat working [Done, just not with a WebTV-like theme - the WebTV HD Chat theme (which is nonfunctional) can still be accessed by clicking on Around Town]
✓ Make it use a random logo every startup [Done, with the addition of adding a user-selectable logo!]
✓ Possibly remake MSN and 2.9 homepages [Done]
✓ Make a whole new home page - SKCro home [Ended up making this into a sitewide theme]
✓ Restructure directories since the root dir is flooded with stuff [Done]
✓ Make a joke "phishing email" [Done, and with a revamped mail system to boot!]
✓ Remake Favorites --and Explore-- (about time too!) [Done with favorites, Explore just plays the Petscop track of the same name as an easter egg since it can't be remade]
✓ Make showAlert more flexible (allow HTML, changable icon, custom button labels/actions, etc) [Done via a custom function, showCustomAlert()]
✓ Fix settings page grid layout [Done]
/ Add a proper road animation [Abandoned for now; Screwing around with rotate3d(), may have to resort to an iframe]
✓ Redesign the mobile app icon again to include the "HD" text [Done]
✓ Add an FAQ page [Pretty much done]
✓ Fix panel styles for mobile [Done]
✓ Create a "WebTV HD compatibility script" of sorts that lets you make your site WTV-HD-friendly just by adding a script to each page on your site [Done, just add this to the bottom of each page: <script src=https://skcro.github.io/WebTV-HD/js/wtv-hd.js></script>]
✓ Remove as many direct iframe accesses as possible - use postMessage API instead. [Done, with a couple exceptions]
✓ Add Plus screensaver [Pretty much done]
✓ Recreate webtv.net homepage [Done]
x Finish Yahoo and Beenz recreations [I've basically abandoned these lol]
✓ Implement customizable username [Done]
✓ Add status indicator animation for page loads [Done]
✓ Remove Herobrine [Done]

COMMIT MESSAGE WITH CHANGELOG
-----------------------------

The wait is finally over! This is the long-awaited part 4 of the Iframe Overhaul™, a 4-part overhaul that makes WebTV HD act more like real WebTV.
I'm sorry this took over a year, and it's probably very underwhelming, but I couldn't bear to wait any longer and I haven't actually done much work on it recently.
Merry Christmas, I guess.

Major additions/changes:
Organized directory structure! The root directory is no longer flooded with various pages, making the code a bit easier to work with.
Cleaned up a lot of code and made the coding style more consistent. Yeah, I know, the spacing is weird.
Added more links to the Home page to show off the new stuff.
Added more home page variations, including 1999, MSN, and 2.9.
Added the SKCro Blue theme.
Added Favorites. No, you can't save pages to it, sorry.
Added a more customizable showAlert variation called showCustomAlert. It's a bit janky, but I guess it works for now.
Added an FAQ page to answer common questions about the project.
Added a randomized startup logo so that I can finally make use of the other logos that I added 100 commits ago. You can also manually select a logo in Setup.
Added web-app-related stuff to the index page.
Added favicons for more types of devices (including Safari's tab bar).
Added 401 page (which was only used for the beta-testing server, but I'm keeping it in because it's funny).
Added a proper TV Home page. It's no longer just a background image with no functionality.
Added .nojekyll so updates (hopefully) push faster in the future.
Added a recreation of webtv.net.
Added a "WebTV HD compatibility script" that you can add to your site to make it work better with WebTV HD. See the script's comments for details.
Added a help(); command. This can be run from the console and will list out every user-friendly command.
Re-introduced selectionBox.js since I'm tired of syncing 2 versions across main.js and iframe.js.
Fixed Setup layout and added a couple new pages to it.
FINALLY fixed the selection box scroll bug.
Removed CSS-based selection box design in favor of an inline SVG.
Removed requirement for selection box to be built into the page - it's now added dynamically.
Remade the cursors in SVG so they're more scalable and look nicer on high-res displays.
Redesigned the mobile app icon (again) to include the "HD" text.
Redid a bunch of pages so they use more semantic HTML.
Increased performance all-around by removing delays and optimizing code.

With this new update, I'll also be adopting a new release strategy - the GitHub will be treated more like a production service, meaning updates are only released once I'm sure they're stable.

Full changelog:
Changed bug report, feature request, and feedback templates so they're a bit easier to use.
Added .htaccess and .htpasswd to the .gitignore (those were only used on my local beta-testing server).
Kept checklist in there. It was initially used to keep track of changes I needed to make, but I left it in there so y'all could see it.
Attempted to fix 404 page yet again.
Moved apple-touch-icon to the root directory so that the extra meta tag isn't needed.
Added a few more sound effects (and modified a couple).
Added "knockoff" sounds from the infamous Italian WebTV trial box. Y'know, the one that runs Windows CE. (If you don't get the reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZZsOSi2F4s)
Added easter egg pertaining to said box: if you manage to get a "knockoff" logo (1/1000 chance), you'll get the knockoff sounds too, as well as a couple string changes.
Added "Explore" track from Petscop as a placeholder for the Explore feature :P
Restructured audio folder slightly.
Redid splash sound because the old one sounded a bit weird.
Added webmanifest thing for web app funnies.
Added BrowserConfig.xml for all you people who pin websites to your start menus via IE for some reason.
Changed code of conduct slightly.
Condensed most of the CSS by removing spacing for one-liners and removing the extra space behind all "{" characters.
Attempted to make CSS rule orders more consistent.
Added favorites CSS to go along with the page.
Merged community.css into home.css.
Modified setup, both page-wise and CSS-wise.
Attempted to prevent scrolling on index page by adding overflow:hidden; to the HTML element itself.
Fixed progressbar style by using a background image for the fill rather than a gradient. (Thanks to Upwader for this suggestion)
Removed unnecessary placeholder styles from iframe.css.
Added a proper favicon with multiple sizes.
Optimized most SVGs by getting rid of the unnecessary Inkscape stuff.
Sorted all images into the root images folder.
Added stupid ads for MSN/2.9 home pages.
Added JS alert function and icon, overriding the default alert() behavior.
Fixed show/hide animations for statusbar, options bar, and panels (hopefully).
Modified local audioscope code fork to match my coding style.
Simplified sound playback code so I don't need to define "playXSound" for every sound.
Moved audio playback handling to parent page.
Simplified PowerOn logic and made it more consistent.
Added basic mail js handler that loads a different message based on the ID in the URL.
Added settings js handler for username and startup logo changes.
Removed the tl;dr from the license since it was confusing GitHub.
Added preload/prerender stuff to the PowerOn page so the home page should (hopefully) load faster.
Updated readme to reorganize info slightly.
Added robots.txt and sitemap.xml for SEO stuff.
Removed TODO file since I never used it :P
Removed sidebar-shadow divs since the effect now uses ::after.
Redid chat pages to scale better.
Added bottom fade to the chat content page.
Removed "Contact me" page since it was unnecessary (as my contact info is in the readme).
Removed ProgressBarDebug page since it's no longer necessary.
Fixed WebTV logo on setup page.
Added warning to settings page noting that some things don't work properly.
Converted audioscope code fork to my coding style.
Finally stopped using var in most places.
Redid sidebar and options/statusbar animations to use `translate` rather than `bottom`/`left` for better performance.
Finally swapped out home page top bar table for a flexbox.
Changed linkHandler() function to go() because it's shorter, easier to remember, and has a more obvious function.
A lot more that I can't remember because I've done so much.

oh, and IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:
ie 11 stupid
Thank you for your time.

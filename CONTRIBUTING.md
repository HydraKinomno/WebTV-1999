# Contributing to WebTV HD
Want to contribute to the project? Great! There are a few rules you'll need to follow, though.

## Reporting bugs
If you want to report a bug, head on over to our [bug report template](https://github.com/SKCro/WebTV-HD/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+) and fill in the blanks. Make sure to provide screenshots and a video, if necessary.

If you need a screen recorder, use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) - it's a little complicated to set up, but it doesn't leave a watermark on your videos. I can't provide a full tutorial here, but there are plenty on YouTube. If you're on iOS, there's a built-in screen recorder accessible from the Control Center. If you're on Android, there are plenty of screen recorder apps out there (and there might even be one built into your phone).

## Suggesting features
Want to see a feature added to WebTV HD? Fill in our [feature request template](https://github.com/SKCro/WebTV-HD/issues/new?assignees=SKCro&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BRequest%5D+). Make sure to clearly describe what you want added - low-effort posts like "plz add x feature" without a clear explanation may not be considered. If your suggestion is unclear, we will ask you to clarify. Do note that **suggesting a feature may not always result in it being added:** Some advanced features may not be able to be added at this time, and will be marked as such. I may or may not return to these suggestions later, but I can't guarantee anything.

## Contributing code
You want to contribute code? **That's awesome!** Create a fork of the project and make changes to that. When you're done coding, [make a pull request](https://github.com/SKCro/WebTV-HD/compare). The only rules are to make sure that your code works and doesn't clash with mine - I'll need to be able to merge it without too many issues.

Your code must also add something meaningful to the project - minor changes to text (unless it's spelling/grammar-related), branding, or images (unless it's something major, like a full SVG recreation of an icon) probably won't be merged.

## Crediting
If you contributed code, your name will be added to the Credits page, along with what you contributed. If you want, your website or social media profile (preferably GitHub) can also be linked there.

A credits listing generally looks something like this:
`- YourName, for adding x and y, as well as fixing z`

Your GitHub profile should also appear in the contributors list on the repo's main page. If it doesn't, let me know and I'll tag you in my next commit.
